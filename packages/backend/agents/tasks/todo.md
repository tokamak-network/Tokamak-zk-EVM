# Plan
- [x] Confirm scope of commit (includes files outside `packages/backend`) and target remote/branch (current branch `jake-prove-optim` now tracks `origin/jake-prove-optim`).
- [x] Stage all requested changes (including untracked `agents/`).
- [x] Commit with the agreed message.
- [x] Push to the agreed remote/branch.

# Review
- [x] Verify commit contains all expected files and no unintended omissions.
- [x] Verify push completed successfully.
