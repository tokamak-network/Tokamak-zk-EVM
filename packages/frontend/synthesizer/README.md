# Tokamak-zk-EVM/Synthesizer

## Overview
Synthesizer is a compiler that takes an Ethereum transaction as input and returns a wire map (in the form of a permutation map). Combined with the library subcircuits in [qap-compiler package](../qap-compiler), this wire map forms a zkp circuit specialized for the transaction. The transaction specific-circuit will be used as preprocessed input for [Tokamak zk-SNARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/507).

## Features
- Preliminary work for zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- Seamless integration with Ethereum's EVM
- Efficient witness calculation for zk-proofs
- TypeScript/JavaScript friendly API for blockchain developers

## Installation

To obtain the latest version, simply require the project using `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

This package provides the core Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation which is capable of executing EVM-compatible bytecode. The package has been extracted from the [@ethereumjs/vm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/vm) package along the VM `v6` release.

## Usage
* Playground (will be updated soon)
> 📘 **Note**: Full example code and detailed explanations can be found in the [examples directory](./examples).
