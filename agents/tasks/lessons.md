- When a request says "2번 job" in a workflow context, clarify whether it means "second job order" or "split into two jobs" before planning changes.
- When making claims about CLI argument expectations, verify against current usage or ask for confirmation before asserting a mismatch.
- When a user asks for a test script, confirm whether they expect a Rust test instead of an external shell runner before implementing.
- When a user says "x_size/y_size", confirm they mean polynomial dimensions (numerator size) rather than parameter symbols like denom degrees.
